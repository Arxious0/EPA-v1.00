# EPA-v1.00
**(Exam Paper Analysis v1.00)**

This is an experimental tool created by me with the goal of being able to accurately analyse exam papers, give predicted scores based on past paper scores using mathematics and trend analysis, and be able to accurately break down topic weaknesses and areas of improvement. This tool is under development and not completed as of now. 
The aim is to make it stable for release and then overhaul it with a GUI for easy input. The development process will be recorded here. Anyone is free to view it or suggest improvements!
